Head [Seafloor Modeling](https://www.geomar.de/en/research/fb4/fb4-muhs/research-topics/modelings) and [Seafloor Morphology](https://www.geomar.de/en/research/fb4/fb4-muhs/research-topics/modelings) groups at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel.

Personal account.

I study and model the processes shaping the ocean floor, combining geophysical fluid dynamics, 
numerical modeling, and seafloor observations.

🔬 **Research interests:** Seafloor processes • Geodynamics • Hydrothermal systems  
💻 **Software:** OpenFOAM-based solvers, geophysical data tools
